# SensorTraining_Final
Notes and source files from a Sensors introductory training. Code targeting an ESP32.

Arduino sketches to gather data from sensors for use in labs. Participants should use the base sketch, make changes, and observe the data gathered in a cloud service. All sketches are merged from Adafruit sample sketches.

These sketches were used by the Lab 1 team using a RISC-V ESP32 core. These are the only customized labs. The Lab 2 team used entirely samples which are distributed with sensors or the Arduino IDE, so if you were in Lab 2, you can find the samples in your IDE.

The Adafruit Boards require an ESP32 Arduino Core which is not a part of standard IDE installations. You can add this hardware support to your Arduino enviorment by following the instructions here: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
